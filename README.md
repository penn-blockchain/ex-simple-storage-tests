Intro to testing Ethereum Smart Contracts.

## What is all this stuff?

Don't let all the new folders and files in this example scare you away. For now, we only care about the contracts and test folder. These folders and files are generated by (Truffle)[truffleframework.com], which is a tool (or set of tools) that helps us write better smart contracts!

## What does this example teach?

In the previous example, we explored how to write a super simple Ethereum smart contract that stored a single integer. However, 

Writing secure smart contracts is very hard (INSERT LINK TO HACKS), and one major part of this is making sure the contract is adequately tested. Here, we will be learning how to write tests for our smart contracts in JavaScript. 

Some previous JavaScript expirence is helpful, but no worries if you no nothing. This is example is so simple you will be able to follow!
